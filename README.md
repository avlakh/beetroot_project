Hi!

My name is Artem Vlakh and I am a junior frontend developer. Having worked my way through the frontend courses by Ukrainian learning school Beetroot Academy, I've created this final project. 

This project is a website of a webdesign studio called "{finsweet" that helps customers create their own websites. 

This project is powered by Vue 3 framework and includes 11 webpages - 2 of those are templates for dynamic creation. I've used the components approach, trying to avoid the repetitive code. Also, I've used NEWS Api, but unfortunately version that is deployed to Github can't allow you to view, but the functionality is in the code :) 

RWD is fully optimized. 

Here's the link to the website - https://avlakh.github.io/beetroot_project/#/

Please let me know if you have any feedback or suggestions - I'm happy to improve it :)

Cheers!
