Hi!

My name is Artem Vlakh and I am a junior frontend developer. Having worked my way through the frontend courses by Ukrainian learning school Beetroot Academy, I've created this final project. 

This project is a website of a webdesign studio called "{finsweet" that helps customers create their own websites. 

This project is powered by Vue 3 framework and includes 11 webpages - 2 of those are templates for dynamic webpages. I've used the components approach, trying to avoid the repetitive code. Also, I've used NEWS Api, but unfortunately due to localhost limitation of the API, the Github-hosted version doesn't show the live functionality. You can check the code though ;) 

List of technologies used in a project: Vue3, Vanilla JS, Telegram API, SCSS, RWD optimized, Axios, slider & accordion plugins, basic SEO. 

Here's the [link to the website.](https://avlakh.github.io/beetroot_project/#/)

Please let me know if you have any feedback or suggestions - I'm happy to improve it :)

Cheers!
